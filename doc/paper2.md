# Adaptive Probability Density Estimation Using Hierarchical Space Partitioning

## Abstract

We present a novel approach to probability density estimation that combines hierarchical space partitioning with adaptive rule generation to model complex, high-dimensional distributions. Our method constructs tree-based models that recursively partition the sample space using entropy-based fitness functions and multiple partitioning strategies including principal component analysis (PCA) and k-d tree metrics. The resulting models support efficient density estimation, sampling, and geometric operations such as slicing and projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various synthetic distributions and provide a comprehensive framework for probabilistic modeling with applications in machine learning and statistical analysis.

## 1. Introduction

Probability density estimation is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning, with applications ranging from data analysis to generative modeling. Traditional parametric approaches assume specific distributional forms, while non-parametric methods often struggle with high-dimensional data or complex geometric structures. We propose a hybrid approach that adaptively partitions the sample space using multiple metrics and optimization criteria.

Our contribution is threefold: (1) a flexible framework for hierarchical space partitioning with pluggable partitioning rules, (2) entropy-based fitness functions that balance data density and volume considerations, and (3) support for geometric operations on the resulting probability models including slicing, projection, and model arithmetic.

## 2. Related Work

Space partitioning methods for density estimation have been explored in various forms. K-d trees [1] provide efficient nearest-neighbor queries but struggle with high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality. Adaptive histograms [2] partition space based on data density but lack principled optimization criteria. Decision trees for density estimation [3] use information-theoretic criteria but typically focus on axis-aligned splits.

Our approach extends these methods by incorporating multiple partitioning strategies, including PCA-based linear partitioning and k-d tree metrics, within a unified framework optimized using entropy-based fitness functions.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Hierarchical Space Partitioning

We model probability distributions using a tree structure where each node represents a region of the sample space. The root node encompasses the entire domain, and child nodes represent disjoint partitions of their parent's region.

Formally, let $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ be the sample space and $D = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ be a set of sample points. Each node $v$ in our tree is associated with:

- A spatial volume $V(v) \subseteq \mathcal{X}$
- A data subset $D(v) = \{x_i \in D : x_i \in V(v)\}$
- A partitioning rule $R(v)$ (if $v$ is not a leaf)

### 3.2 Partitioning Rules

We implement several partitioning strategies:

**Dimensional Partitioning:** Splits along coordinate axes at optimal threshold values:
$$R_{\text{dim}}(x) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x_j < \theta \\
1 & \text{if } x_j \geq \theta
\end{cases}$$

where $j$ is the selected dimension and $\theta$ is the threshold.

**PCA-based Linear Partitioning:** Projects data onto principal components and partitions along the direction of maximum variance:
$$R_{\text{PCA}}(x) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } \mathbf{v}^T(x - \boldsymbol{\mu}) < \theta \\
1 & \text{if } \mathbf{v}^T(x - \boldsymbol{\mu}) \geq \theta
\end{cases}$$

where $\mathbf{v}$ is the principal eigenvector, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the centroid, and $\theta$ is the threshold.

**K-d Tree Metrics:** Uses distance-based metrics for partitioning based on nearest-neighbor relationships.

### 3.3 Fitness Functions

We evaluate partitioning quality using entropy-based fitness functions that balance data distribution and volume considerations:

**Volume Entropy:** Minimizes the entropy weighted by volume:
$$F_{\text{vol}}(P) = -\sum_{i} \frac{|V_i|}{|V|} \cdot \frac{|D_i|}{|D|} \log_2\left(\frac{|D_i|}{|D|}\right)$$

**Data Entropy:** Minimizes the entropy weighted by data count:
$$F_{\text{data}}(P) = -\sum_{i} \frac{|D_i|}{|D|} \log_2\left(\frac{|V_i|}{|V|}\right)$$

**Hybrid Entropy:** Combines both considerations:
$$F_{\text{hybrid}}(P) = -\sum_{i} \min\left(\frac{|V_i|}{|V|} \log_2\left(\frac{|D_i|}{|D|}\right), \frac{|D_i|}{|D|} \log_2\left(\frac{|V_i|}{|V|}\right)\right)$$

### 3.4 Optimization

For each node, we select the partitioning rule and parameters that maximize the chosen fitness function. We use exhaustive search over candidate split points for dimensional partitioning and eigenvalue decomposition for PCA-based partitioning.

## 4. Model Operations

### 4.1 Density Estimation

For a query point $x$, we traverse the tree to find the leaf node $v$ containing $x$. The density estimate is:
$$\hat{p}(x) = \frac{|D(v)|/|D|}{|V(v)|}$$

### 4.2 Sampling

We sample from the model by:
1. Selecting a leaf node with probability proportional to its data weight
2. Sampling uniformly from the selected node's volume

### 4.3 Geometric Operations

**Slicing:** Given a constraint region $C$, we create a new model by intersecting each node's volume with $C$ and updating weights accordingly.

**Projection:** We marginalize over specified dimensions by collapsing the tree structure and aggregating weights for nodes that project to the same region.

**Model Arithmetic:** We support addition and other operations between models by constructing cross-products of their tree structures.

## 5. Experimental Results

We evaluate our method on several synthetic distributions:

### 5.1 Snake Distribution
A 3D curved manifold generated using spline interpolation with Gaussian noise. Our method successfully captures the underlying structure using PCA-based partitioning.

### 5.2 Logistic Map Distribution
A chaotic attractor generated using the 3D logistic map. The hierarchical partitioning adapts to the fractal structure of the distribution.

### 5.3 Mixture of Gaussians
Standard benchmark distributions. Our method performs comparably to traditional mixture model approaches while providing additional geometric flexibility.

### 5.4 Performance Metrics

We measure performance using:
- **Density Accuracy:** Cross-entropy between true and estimated densities
- **Sample Quality:** Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests on marginal distributions
- **Computational Efficiency:** Tree construction time and query performance

Results show that our method achieves competitive density estimation accuracy while providing superior geometric operation support compared to traditional approaches.

## 6. Applications

### 6.1 Anomaly Detection
The hierarchical structure naturally identifies low-density regions for anomaly detection applications.

### 6.2 Conditional Modeling
Slicing operations enable efficient conditional density estimation without retraining.

### 6.3 Data Visualization
Projection operations support high-dimensional data visualization by marginalizing over subsets of dimensions.

## 7. Limitations and Future Work

Current limitations include:
- Computational complexity grows with dimensionality
- Performance depends on the choice of fitness function
- Limited theoretical guarantees on convergence

Future work will explore:
- Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting
- Online learning algorithms for streaming data
- Extension to non-Euclidean spaces

## 8. Conclusion

We have presented a flexible framework for probability density estimation using adaptive hierarchical space partitioning. Our approach combines multiple partitioning strategies with entropy-based optimization to create models that support both accurate density estimation and efficient geometric operations. The framework's modularity allows for easy extension with new partitioning rules and fitness functions, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in machine learning and statistical analysis.

## Appendix A: Implementation Details

The implementation consists of several key components:

### A.1 Core Architecture
```java
// Simplified class hierarchy
abstract class NodeBase<T> {
    SpacialVolume region;
    PartitionRule rule;
    List<T> children;
    double getWeight();
    VolumeMetric getVolume();
}

class PointNode extends NodeBase<PointNode> {
    Collection<double[]> dataPoints;
    void addDataPoint(double[] point);
}
```

### A.2 Partitioning Rules
The framework supports pluggable partitioning rules through the `PartitionRule` interface:

```java
interface PartitionRule {
    int evaluate(double[] point);
    int getPartitions();
    SpacialVolume[] getSubVolumes();
}
```

### A.3 Fitness Functions
Fitness evaluation is handled by the `SplitFitness` interface:

```java
interface SplitFitness {
    double getFitness(PointNode node,
                     List<VolumeDataDensity> partitions);
}
```

This modular design enables easy experimentation with different partitioning strategies and optimization criteria.
